# Computer Vision RPS
This project teachers the computer how toplay recognise rock , paper , scissors by using images. The aim of the project is for the computer to succesffuly recognise the imagies that were inouted and to select the right one ( rock or papr or scissors) and to play a succesful game of rock paper , scissors with th euser via webcam, what i have learned is that  the more iages used the better the success rate as using if u only have limited options u ay end up using another one that the computer wont reoocgnise for example : ur left hand or a different angle so its important to input s much images as you can to teach the computer, i have also learnt that there are a lot of components that go into tecahing the computer how to play a succefful game using the webcam and images to capture the users inout data, this adds a perosnal touch to the gam ehwich makes the user feel as if thy could be playing the game with an actual human as teh computer is able to recognise thier input and also compete against them adding a caompetetive side.
